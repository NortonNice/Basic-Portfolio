        <p>Hi there! I'm Nate Evans. I was born and raised in Dearborn, Michigan, the land of Henry Ford and the best falafel on Planet Earth. Way back when, I majored in Audio Production before ultimately switching to a focus on Art History. I've moved around a bit, from Detroit to Chicago and finally San Diego, by beloved adopted home. Here in SD I spend my days serving up craft cocktails and locally brewed beer. Whenever I'm not at work, I love exploring all that Southern California has to offer with my wonderful wife Michele.
            </p>
        <p>Recently, I've taken up coding and begun the process of learning all I can about web development. I'm excited about the freedom of expression that it offers, as well as the challenge of learning something tottaly unfamiliar. Hopefully with time and effort, I'll master the craft and reach new heights.
